# moneycontrol_comment_extractor
Since moneycontrol is dynamic website I have used selenium. The code is for extracting comments from stock website from moneycontrol. 
We can use it for more than one urls. 
After installing libraries and setting url site, download selenium chromium browser.
It will be used for generating link for data extraction. 
Select the particular card from the browser and run it on the loop. Extract different required features by using x_path.
Finally, I have downloaded the csv file with three attributes - username, comments, date. More can be added easily.
